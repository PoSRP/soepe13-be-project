\section{Initial project description}

This project will focus on extending and examining the functionality of the SOEM library inside a ROS2 environment. This will be achieved as a two phase process. 

\textbf{Phase 1} will contain integrating the SOEM library into a ROS2 Node as a server-type EtherCAT management and control interface. Alongside, a supporting ESI schema parser which will expose drive capabilities to the EtherCAT server, and an RQt integrated control dashboard to allow user-friendly control over the network will be developed. 

\textbf{Phase 2} will contain an examination of a specific EtherCAT servo drive, specifically extending the developed dashboard to be usable for parameter, friction, and system inertia estimation. To support the estimations, a demonstration of visual data presentation in a ROS-like manner is also included. 

\subsection{Phase 1}
\subsubsection{Description}

\noindent
Developing a ROS2 Node to serve as an EtherCAT Master using the SOEM library. The Node would be responsible for the following:  

\vspace{6pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Control of the EtherCAT Master FSM.
	\item Control of each slave CiA-402 FSM.
	\item Providing Messages, Actions, and Services on the ROS2 network from the EtherCAT network, to facilitate reading and writing EtherCAT network parameters. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{6pt}

\noindent
Developing an RQt integrated dashboard for the EtherCAT server Node. It would provide the following:

\vspace{6pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Ability to send each specific state changing command to the network or specific slave.
	\item Ability to select network or specific slave state and have it automatically change.
	\item Ability to view the state of each part of the EtherCAT network.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{6pt}

\noindent
Developing a ROS2 ESI parser to provide the following:
\vspace{6pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Reading and parsing \textit{EtherCAT Slave Information} files.
	\item Exposing the specific EtherCAT slave capabilities and information to the ROS2 network. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2}
\subsubsection{Description}

\noindent
Utilizing one of the synchronous motion profiles defined in CiA-402 for estimation of system parameters, including but perhaps not limited to the following:

\vspace{6pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Friction
	\item System inertia
	\item Resonance frequency
\end{itemize}
\vspace{6pt}

This will also include presenting achieved and expected motions to the user though an RQt integrated interface, as well as relevant information related to the motion.
