\section{Initial project description}

This project will focus on extending the functionality of the Simple Open EtherCAT Master [SOEM] library inside a ROS2 environment.

SOEM: \url{https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/soem} 

\subsection{Phase 1}
\subsubsection{Description}

\noindent
Developing a ROS2 Node to serve as an EtherCAT Master using the SOEM library. The Node would be responsible for the following:  

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Control of the EtherCAT Finite State Machine [FSM].
	\item Control of slave CiA-402 FSMs.
	\item Providing Messages, Actions, and Services on the ROS2 network from the EtherCAT network, to facilitate reading and writing to the EtherCAT network parameters. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Developing an RQt integrated explorer for the parameters presented by the EtherCAT Master Node. It would provide the following:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Ability to select specific slave parameters and collate them in a collected view.
	\item Ability to view and set parameters through the collected view.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Developing an RQt integrated control panel for the EtherCAT server Node. It would provide the following:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Ability to send each specific state changing command to the network or specific slave.
	\item Ability to select network or specific slave state and have it automatically change.
	\item Ability to view the state of each part of the EtherCAT network.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Investigation}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item How to achieve easy ROS2 integration of various EtherCAT drives compliant to the CiA-402 communication profile.  
	\item How to fascilitate updating of EtherCAT network parameters through a ROS2 integrated interface.  
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Experimentation} 

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Connecting devices from different manufacturers and verifying discovery results against manufacturer specifications. 
	\item Setting and verifying network parameters through a basic interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Components}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item ROS2 EtherCAT Server Node
	\item RQt Network Parameter Explorer 
	\item RQt Network and Slave FSM Controls
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2}
\subsubsection{Description}

\noindent
Developing a generalized quality parameter for evaluating movement profiles and developing a generalized procedure for estimating setup friction within the CiA-402 profile, if possible.

\noindent
Developing an interface for running predefined movement profiles. It would provide the following:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Planning of typical motion profiles (synchronous). 
	\item Assignment of slave(s) to run during movement. 
	\item Graphing of the expected versus achieved movement. 
	\item Information about expected and achieved movements.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Investigation}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item How to quantify the quality of an achieved movement profile.  
	\item How to generalize friction estimation using CiA-402.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Experimentation}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Examination using disturbed vs undisturbed drive movement.  
	\item Comparison of friction values calculated using different methods.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Components}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item RQt Profile Movement Control Panel
	\item RQt EtherCAT CiA-402 Compliance Tester
\end{itemize}
