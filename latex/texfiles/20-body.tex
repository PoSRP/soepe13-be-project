\section{Overview}

\subsection{Mechanical setup}

Hey thats a good photo you got there.

Linear rail with ~45cm motion, ECT60 controller, some stepper, some encoder, some plastics.

\subsection{EtherCAT library selection}

Various libraries for interfacing with the EtherCAT network stack are available. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item SimpleOpenEthercatMaster [SOEM]
	\item Manufacturer implementations
	\item EcMaster
	\item EtherLab
\end{itemize}

The SOEM library was selected due to many good things and open-source-ness.

The standard is still not fully developed? 

\subsection{ROS application structure}

Wow, that's a really cool illustration here.

\subsubsection{Real-time control node}

This node runs the real-time loop.

\subsubsection{Tuning strategy node}

This node manages the real-time controlling node and does calculations, planning, bla bla.

\subsubsection{User-facing node}

This node provides an interface to view and interact with the ROS system.
