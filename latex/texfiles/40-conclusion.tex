\section{Conclusion}

Scope should have been different.

Doing this in ROS did not make it easier as was intended. 
Just another layer of complexity that could have been handled differently.
Communication between processes is nice for avoiding escalating privileges of entire application, which does not matter for a research project. 

Additional knowledge of the CiA protocol would also have helped, as I thought it would be possible to automatically determine control parameters in the device object dictionary.
