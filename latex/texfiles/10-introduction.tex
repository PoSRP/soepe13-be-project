\section{Introduction}

Advancements in robotics require sophisticated motor control.
To achieve the required level of real-time precision and performance while decreasing the material requirements for systems with multiple motors placed further apart, various bus-communication protocols for long distance motor control have been introduced. 

One of such protocols is the EtherCAT network protocol.
The EtherCAT protocol is capable of utilizing existing standard network controllers for the controlling device and implements specialized slave network devices to achieve exceptionally low jitter and high network refresh rates. 

Something about distributed motor control systems, motors placed far apart while still requiring exact time precision and synchronization of multiple actuators.
