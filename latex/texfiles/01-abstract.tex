\section{Abstract}

This project attempts to determine if automatic tuning of motor controller parameters is achievable for the general EtherCAT CiA-402 slave motor controller device. 

As the specific implementation of internal motor control loop varies between each manufacturer or device, it is often not possible to migrate an exact tuning strategy to other devices without additional specific implementations.
