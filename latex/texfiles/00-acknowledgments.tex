\section{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to my supervisor at SDU, Aljaz Kramberger.\\
Thanks to my company contact at Kobots, Nikki Lemann.\\

Due to unfortunate circumstances concerning Kobots A/S nearly going bankrupt, the project was stunted by a lack of material support.
It is my opinion that Kobots has not fulfilled reasonable expectations to aid in the process and completion of the project. 
The additional time required to develop the mechanical setup greatly stunted progress as it became a budget solution due to me paying from my own pocket.

Fuck.
